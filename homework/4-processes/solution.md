## Problem 1

#### Problem

Run `process-run.py` with the following flags: `-l 5:100,5:100`. What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of the CPU is in use?) Why do you know this? Use the `-c` and `-p` flags to see if you were right.

#### My Answer

The percent of time the CPU is in use must be $100\% (= 10/10)$.
We don't have any reason to block, so it will just finish the process0 (or process1) and then finish the other one.

#### Correct Answer

```bash
$ uv run process-run.py -l 5:100,5:100 -c -p
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs

  2        RUN:cpu         READY             1          
  3        RUN:cpu         READY             1

## Problem 2

#### Problem

Now run with these flags: `./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0`. These flags specify one process with 4 instructions (all to use the CPU), and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done.
How long does it take to complete both processes?
Use `-c` and `-p` to find out if you were right.

#### My Answer

Ideally takes 5 (if the time for waiting is less than 5).

If we run process1 first and run process0 while waiting for the I/O, then it takes 5.

#### Correct Answer

```bash
$ uv run process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0 -c -p
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs

## Problem 3

#### Problem

Switch the order of the processes: `-l 1:0,4:100`. What happens now? Does switching the order matter? Why? (As always, use `-c` and `-p` to see if you were right)

#### My Answer

Based on the result of problem 2, we can observe that:
- process with smaller PID comes first
- I/O block takes 5, and `RUN:io_done` takes additional 1. Total of 6.

My speculation:
- time 1: process0 runs first
- time 2: process1 runs since process0 is blocked
- time 6: process1 done, but process0 is still blocked
- time 7: process0 runs and do `RUN:io_done`

#### Correct Answer

```bash
$ uv run process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -p
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs

```

## Problem 4

#### Problem

Weâ€™ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is `-S`, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to SWITCH_ON_END, the system will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END`), one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work?

#### My Answer

| Time | PID: 0 | PID: 1 | CPU | IOs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | RUN:io | READY | 1 | |
| 2 | BLOCKED | READY | | 1 |
| 3 | BLOCKED | READY | | 1 |

## Problem 5

#### Problem

Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set to switch to another process whenever one is WAITING for I/O (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO`). What happens now? Use `-c` and `-p` to confirm that you are right.

## Problem 6

#### Problem

One other important behavior is what to do when an I/O completes. With `-I IO_RUN_LATER`, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it is not necessarily run right away; rather, whatever was running at the time keeps running. What happens when you run this combination of processes? (`./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -c -p -I IO_RUN_LATER`) Are system resources being effectively utilized?

#### My Answer

When it comes to CPU utilization, yes it is effective. We use CPU in all the 17 times.

## Problem 7

#### Problem

Now run the same processes, but with `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` set, which immediately runs the process that issued the I/O. How does this behavior differ? Why might running a process that just completed an I/O again be a good idea?

#### My Answer

In this case, running a process that just completed an I/O again is a good idea, because it makes it possible to run CPU while doing I/O simultaneously.

## Problem 8

#### Problem

Now run with some randomly generated processes using flags `-s 1 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 2 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 3 -l 3:50,3:50`. See if you can predict how the trace will turn out. What happens when you use the flag `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` versus that flag `-I IO_RUN_LATER`? What happens when you use the flag `-S SWITCH_ON_IO` versus `-S SWITCH_ON_END`?

#### My Answer

<!-- Think of the four cases:
1. `IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` and `SWITCH_ON_IO`
2. `IO_RUN_LATER` and `SWITCH_ON_IO`
3. `IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` and `SWITCH_ON_END`
4. `IO_RUN_LATER` and `SWITCH_ON_END` -->

In terms of total time, I guess:
- `-S SWITCH_ON_IO` is faster than `-S SWITCH_ON_END`.
- no difference on `IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` and `IO_RUN_LATER`
