## Problem 1

### Problem

First build main-race.c. Examine the code so you can see the (hopefully obvious) data race in the code. Now run helgrind (by `typing valgrind --tool=helgrind main-race`) to see how it reports the race. Does it point to the right lines of code? What other information does it give to you?

### Answer

## Problem 2

### Problem

What happens when you remove one of the offending lines of code? Now add a lock around one of the updates to the shared variable, and then around both. What does helgrind report in each of these cases?

### Answer

Remove one of the offending lines of code:
```bash
$ valgrind --tool=helgrind ./main-race
==3772600== Helgrind, a thread error detector
==3772600== Copyright (C) 2007-2017, and GNU GPL'd, by OpenWorks LLP et al.

==3772600== For lists of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -s
==3772600== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```

Add a lock around one of the updates to the shared variable:
```bash

```

## Problem 3

### Problem

Now letâ€™s look at `main-deadlock.c`. Examine the code. This code has a problem known as deadlock (which we discuss in much more depth in a forthcoming chapter). Can you see what problem it might have?

### Answer

The deadlock occurs when one thread (probably `p1`) acquires the lock `m1`, and the other thread (probably `p2`) acquires the lock `m2`.

## Problem 4

### Problem

Now run helgrind on this code. What does helgrind report?

### Answer

## Problem 5

### Problem

Now run helgrind on `main-deadlock-global.c`. Examine the code; does it have the same problem that `main-deadlock.c` has? Should helgrind be reporting the same error? What does this tell you about tools like helgrind?

### Answer

It doesn't catch the context with lock `g`.

## Problem 6

### Problem

Letâ€™s next look at `main-signal.c`. This code uses a variable (done) to signal that the child is done and that the parent can now continue. Why is this code inefficient? (what does the parent end up spending its time doing, particularly if the child thread takes a long time to complete?)

### Answer

The parent spends unnecessary CPU resources in the while loop

## Problem 7

### Problem

Now run helgrind on this program. What does it report? Is the code correct?

## Problem 8

### Problem

Now look at a slightly modified version of the code, which is found in `main-signal-cv.c`. This version uses a condition variable to do the signaling (and associated lock). Why is this code preferred to the previous version? Is it correctness, or performance, or both?

### Answer

Better in both correctness and performance (the previous code also works in expected way, but it has data race problem)

## Problem 9

### Problem

Once again run helgrind on `main-signal-cv`. Does it report any errors?

### Answer

```bash
$ valgrind --tool=helgrind ./main-signal-cv
==3773973== Helgrind, a thread error detector
==3773973== Copyright (C) 2007-2017, and GNU GPL'd, by OpenWorks LLP et al.
